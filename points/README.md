## The Goal & Approach
The goal was to find a solution to normalize a set of variables (project, token balance, wallet address) within datasets that were independent from each other. In order to do so, we used a percentile rank system. By plotting where a token holder existed within a percentile range, this was a way to normalize the point distribution between projects to try and keep things fair.
